# RIDICULOPATHY.COM Flash Archive

## Greetings & Explanation

Hello. My name is Mark and between 2000 and 2010 I made a whole bunch of Flash games for
ridiculopathy.com. Some of them were pretty bad. Some were OK. Some you may remember. It was a
lovely time in my life, on which look back on fondly, but the sad truth is that Flash is dead. It
had to die. Flash was too resource hungry and had too many security holes. Could these issues have
been addressed? We may never know for sure, but I do know two things: Flash is gone, and I miss it
every day.

In this repo you will find some (but by no means all) of the games from that period in their raw SWF
format. The games are presented here on an as-is basis. For the reasons mentioned above, Flash is
sketchy. Obviously, if you choose to play these, you do so at your own risk.

## Playing the games

You can find tools like [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/#downloads 'Ruffle') that allow you to play .swf
files on your local machine without much too much trouble.

## Notes

- Not all the features will work. High score functions will reach out to a now-defunct PHP server,
  so expect odd behavior there. Glider works for the classic games, but the custom houses and level
  editor will not work.

- For Rock & Roll Apocalypse, you will also want to have the swinger2intro.flv file for the intro
  video.
